# node-capsule
This is a simple, fully functional Node.js backend server acting as a boilerplate starting point for projects.

With a Route-Controller-Service design pattern file structure, Postgress as a Dockerized SQL database, and Sequelize as the SQL ORM. 

Running it should be as simple as:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/zgantche/node-capsule.git
npm install
npm start
```
