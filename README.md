# node-capsule
Idea is for this to be a fully functional Node.js backend server. 

With a Route-Controller-Service design pattern file structure, Postgress as a Dockerized SQL database, and Sequelize as the SQL ORM. 

Running it should be as simple as:
```
git clone https://github.com/zgantche/node-capsule.git
npm install
npm start
```
